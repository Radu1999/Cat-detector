# Cat-detector
Using numerical methods algorithms and machine learning to detect the images that contain cats.

part-1 : Jacobi factorization + sparse -> csr conversion
part-2 : Clustering Algorithm
part-3 : Algorithm to detect images that contain cats based on training(learning based on histograms).
part-4 : Same algorithm with different learning function
